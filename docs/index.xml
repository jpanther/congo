The config files that ship with Congo contain all of the possible settings that the theme recognises. By default, many of these are commented out but you can simply uncomment them to activate or change a specific feature.
A few things you need to set for a new installation:
# config/_default/config.toml baseURL = &amp;#34;https://your_domain.com&amp;#34; languageCode = &amp;#34;en-AU&amp;#34; title = &amp;#34;My awesome website&amp;#34; [author] name = &amp;#34;Your name&amp;#34; image = &amp;#34;img/author.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/configuration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/configuration/</guid><description>Congo is a highly customisable theme and uses some of the latest Hugo features to simplify how it is configured.
The theme ships with a default configuration that gets you up and running with a basic blog or static website.
Configuration files bundled with the theme are provided in TOML format as this is the default Hugo syntax. Feel free to convert your config to YAML or JSON if you wish.</description></item><item><title>Homepage Layout</title><link>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/homepage-layout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/homepage-layout/</guid><description>Congo provides a fully flexible homepage layout. There are two main templates to choose from with additional settings to adjust the design. Alternatively, you can also provide your own template and have complete control over the homepage content.
The layout of the homepage is controlled by the homepage.layout setting in the params.toml configuration file. Additionally, all layouts have the option to include a listing of recent articles.
Page layout # The default layout is the page layout.</description></item><item><title>Front Matter</title><link>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/front-matter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/front-matter/</guid><description>In addition to the default Hugo front matter parameters, Congo adds a number of additional options to customise the presentation of individual articles. All the available theme parameters are listed below.
Front matter parameter default values are inherited from the theme&amp;rsquo;s base configuration, so you only need to specify these parameters in your front matter when you want to override the default.
